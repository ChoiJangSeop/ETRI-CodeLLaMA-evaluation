# ETRI-CodeLLaMA Evaluation with LLMSecEval

I genereated **30 source codes** by prompting **LLMSecEVal** senarios to **ETRI-CodeLLaMA**.
Then, I evaluate these codes are secure using CodeQL.

Only, 23 generated codes are compilable, 3 codes are modified manual keeping their context and only 4 codes are completely non-compiable.
**eval_result.xlsx** file contains all of information about evaluation result.
